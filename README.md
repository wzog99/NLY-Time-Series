# NLY-Time-Series

### Rationale for this analysis
- SARIMA models are somewhat picky, and are often an inappropriate tool for modeling instances that have a significant amount of external factors (Exogenous features)
- Real Estate Investment Trusts AKA - REIT's are an asset class with muted price fluctuations
- REIT's are required, by law, to distribute a significant amount income in the form of a dividend (at least 90% of taxible income)
- Annaly AKA - NLY currently has one of the larger dividend payments ~11%
- When dividends get distributed there is a corresponding drop in stock price, in a vacuum, that amounts to approximatly the dividend payment
- Does this phenomenon overwhelm the exogenous varibles present in the REIT asset class?


### To-Do list
- Application of LSTR NN
- Inclusion of exogenous variables
